# Mary-Gatua-Trust
### Vision
To create a critical mass of fishermen and women who can go back to their communities and drive the sustainable change desired f.

**How?**
By identifying bright and need students in the community and see them through primary and secondary schooling as well as provide HELB loan adjusted bursaries at tertiary levels. Ideally paying parental contribution and activity fees for one child lessens the burden for other family members.

### Mission
Making a difference one child at a time!
