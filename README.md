Mary Gatua Trust, a non-profit organization driven by volunteer giving.

It is aimed at supporting the needy and bright students from Tharaka Nithi County, specifically around Kithino environment, Chiakariga ward where the founder Gatua's daughter  Winfred ails from. Inspired by her mom's way of giving and her late grandfather who gave to the less fortunate!
