# Mary-Gatua-Trust
### Vision
To create a critical mass of fishermen and women who can go back to their communities and drive the sustainable change desired for thriving and resilient communities.

**How?**
By identifying and supporting bright and needy students in the community and seeing them through primary and secondary schooling as well as provide HELB loan adjusted bursaries at tertiary levels. 
Ideally paying parental contribution and activity fees for one child covers siblings in the same primary institution giving carers a breathing space.

### Mission
Making a difference one child at a time!

## About
Mary Gatua Trust, a non-profit organization driven by volunteer giving.

It is aimed at supporting the needy and bright students from Tharaka Nithi County, specifically around Kithino environment, Chiakariga ward where the founder Gatua's daughter  Winfred ails from. Inspired by her mom's way of giving and her late grandfather who gave to the less fortunate!
